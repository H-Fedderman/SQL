# In this SQL code, I am solving problems in Hackerrank using their provided datasets.

#1. Query all columns for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 100000. The CountryCode for America is USA.
  SELECT * FROM CITY 
  WHERE population > 100000 AND countrycode = 'USA';

#2. Query the NAME field for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 120000.
  SELECT name FROM city
  WHERE countrycode = 'USA' AND population >120000;

#3. Query a list of CITY names from STATION with even ID numbers only. You may print the results in any order, but must exclude duplicates from your answer.
	SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
	FROM STATION 
	WHERE MOD(ID,2)=0 
	ORDER BY CITY ASC;     

#4. Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.
  SELECT COUNT(city) - COUNT(distinct city)
  FROM station
