# In this code, I analyze data from the video game Dead by Daylight using two tables, one for survivors and one for killers. 
# The use_percentage stats were pulled from NightLight and are relevant as of March 2023


#1. What are the top 5 perks that are most used in the game?
  SELECT s.perk_name, CAST(usage_rate as real) AS use_percentage
  FROM BIT_DB.survivors s
  WHERE character_type= 'Survivor' AND use_percentage > 18.4
  UNION
  SELECT k.perk_name, CAST(usage_rate as real) AS use_percentage
  FROM BIT_DB.killers k
  WHERE character_type = 'Killer' AND use_percentage > 14.3
  ORDER BY use_percentage DESC
  LIMIT 5;

#2. What character has the most popular perks? In order to get this, I want to get the average of each characters perk usage
and combine the tables together to see who the top character is.

  SELECT AVG(s.usage_rate) AS popularity, character
  FROM BIT_DB.survivors s
  GROUP BY character
  UNION
  SELECT AVG(k.usage_rate) AS popularity, character
  FROM BIT_DB.killers k
  GROUP BY character
  ORDER BY popularity DESC
  LIMIT 1;

#3. Which perks cause the exposure status effect?
  SELECT s.perk_name AS survivor_perks, k.perk_name AS killer_perks
  FROM BIT_DB.survivors s
  FULL OUTER JOIN BIT_DB.killers k
  ON s.perk_name = k.perk_name
  WHERE s.status_effect_inflicted OR k.status_effect_inflicted LIKE '%expose%';


#4. How many perks are there in the game? Seperate results by survivor and killer.
  SELECT COUNT(s.perk_name) AS survivor_perks, COUNT(k.perk_name) AS killer_perks
  FROM BIT_DB.survivors s
  FULL OUTER JOIN BIT_DB.killers k
  ON s.perk_name = k.perk_name;


#5. Compare the average usage rate for killer perks versus survivor perks.
  SELECT AVG(s.usage_rate) AS avg_survivor, AVG(k.usage_rate) AS avg_killer
  FROM BIT_DB.survivors s
  FULL OUTER JOIN BIT_DB.killers k
  ON s.perk_name = k.perk_name;


#6. What perk(s) cause a boon status effect and help with the action of running?
  SELECT perk_name, perk_action_type, status_effect_inflicted
  FROM BIT_DB.survivors
  WHERE perk_action_type LIKE '%running%' AND status_effect_inflicted LIKE '%boon%';
